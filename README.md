let image = Image(width: 800, height: 600)
image.fill(color: Color(red: 255, green: 255, blue: 255))

// Draw a rectangle
image.rectangle(x1: 50, y1: 50, x2: 150, y2: 150, color: Color(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 255))
image.save(to: "output.png")
```

This code creates a white image and adds a blue rectangle. Modify the parameters to create your desired drawing.
